The HTML file named index.html and CSS file named responsive.css. It is a web page that if you resize the browser screen width, a different part of the image will be rendered. That is:

If the browser screen width is greater than 1200 pixels, display the top-left image of homer.jpg (i.e., the one that reads "Homer's Night Out") If the browser screen width is greater than 1100 pixels but less than or equal to 1200 pixels, display the top-right image (i.e., Homer walking into Moe's). If the browser screen width is greater than 1000 pixels but less than or equal to 1100 pixels, display the second image on the left column (i.e., "Hmm..."). If the browser screen width is greater than 900 pixels but less than or equal to 1000 pixels, display the second image on the right column. If the browser screen width is greater than 800 pixels but less than or equal to 900 pixels, display the third image on the left column. If the browser screen width is greater than 700 pixels but less than or equal to 800 pixels, display the third image on the right column. If the browser screen width is greater than 600 pixels but less than or equal to 700 pixels, display the bottom-left-most image on the left column. If the browser screen width less than or equals to 600 pixels, display the final image on the comic, the bottom-right-most image of homer.jpg that reads "The End".
