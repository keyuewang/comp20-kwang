In this assignment, I used 
a JSON API -- https://secret-about-box.herokuapp.com/sendLocation to send my loaction information and to retrive everyone else's information; 

a third-party JavaScript API -- Google Maps，to display my location on the map with unique marker and info window and display locations of people on the map and info window that displays person's login, message, and miles away from me;

the HTML5 geolocation API(to determine my location) 

and the XMLHttpRequest objects to make requests and manage the response data.

 I spent about 15 hours learning the API that uesd in the index.html，the XMLHttpRequest objects and finishing the assignment.
