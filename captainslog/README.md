# Captain's Log

In this assignment, I used jQuery event method -- keypress to display dynamically in the log section, uesd jQuery prepend method to make the latest update show first. Besides, I also used javascript Date object to get the time and Date prototype toDateString() to make the time human readable. Messages are stored in local storage (setItem method), and will display if you leave the page and return to the page.

I spent about 3 hours learning the jQuery, local storage and Date() object and finished the assignment.

Happy Halloween!
