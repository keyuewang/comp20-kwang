# comp20-kwang

###The purpose of this Git repository
This Git repository is a collection of comp20 labs and assignments. It includes:
* Lab4: Responsive Design
* Lab5: Duck Hunt
* Lab6: Messages
* Lab7: Captain's Log
* Assignment2: Map Chat
* Assignment4: Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side (Assignments 2 and 3)

###My favorite lab or assignment
Assignment2 is my favorite. In Lab6: Messages, I used XMLHttpRequest to parse the JSON file and output the data to a section of a completely loaded HTML file which is totally different from the static html page that I made before. But the JSON file is still static. The big step of assignment 2 is everything is "dynamic" -- when user open my website (http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-kwang/mapchat/), it will generate a new json data to the server(https://shielded-journey-5174.herokuapp.com/sendLocation) and then the page will display all the login information from the server on the Map. Also, it's my first time to learn and use an API(Google map), which is so challenging and interesting.

###How much that I have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I'd like to say -- unbelievable.
Before I took this course, I barely know the knowledge about the web, not even to mention how to build up a web application. During this semester, I learn HTTP, HTML, CSS, JSON, AJAX, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, XSS...and of course, Git. 

###The most important thing that I learned in this course
Read the DOCUMENT from the web.
* learn how to use Google API by reading the Goggle API document.
* learn how to use web application framework for Node.js by reading the Express document.

###What topic would you like to delve deeper into
Web security.
